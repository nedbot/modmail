# Modwire

<b>ðŸš§ Work in progress - please do not use in production ðŸš§</b>

Modmail is a simple communication tool connecting Discord moderators with their members. We are entirely encouraged by [Reddit's Modmail system](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/5vey3n/what_is_modmail_and_how_do_i_send_it/ "What is Modmail?") and are enthusiast about a similar solution for Discord. NedBot Modmail will answer your members' questions in an organised and balanced fashion.
